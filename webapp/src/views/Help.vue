      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        CTFBot is a bot that aids in solving CTFs. It integrates deeply with
        Trello and Discord to bring a unified experience for CTF management.
      </p>
      <p>
        We made CTFBot because we were tired of looking up at CTFTime for new CTFs.
        Furthermore, information about challenges would be buried amongst other chatter
        in our Discord channel, and we wanted a better way to manage this. We put the
        challenges in Trello and manage the discussion and challenge status there.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also find a lot of articles about CTF challenges and the leading edge of the
        Infosec industry. We wanted these articles (refered to as <b class="h-mono">resources</b>)
        to be catalogued, with the option to add our own descriptions.
      </p>

      <h2>CTF Workflow</h2>
      <h3>Finding CTFs</h3>
      <p>
        Every week, CTFBot will put up a list of upcoming online CTFs in the
        <b class="channel">#upcoming</b> channel.
        <img src="/img/help/upcoming-ctf.png">
        You can run <b class="cmd">!addctf &lt;ctf_url&gt;</b> in the
        <b class="channel">#capture-the-flag</b> channel to create a channel for the CTF
        and start tracking it. A new channel will be created in the <b class="category">CTFs</b>
        category, with details about the CTF in an embed message. e.g. start time, end time and
        associated Trello board. Here is an example:
        <b class="cmd">!addctf https://ctftime.org/event/825/</b> will produce:
        <div class="flex flex-wrap">
          <img src="/img/help/new-ctf-category.png">
          <img src="/img/help/ctf-info-embed.png">
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Joining CTFs</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to join an existing CTF channel that someone created, just play along
        when the CTF starts with the credentials provided. If you are the one
        who created the channel, then there are some extra steps:
      </p>

      <p>
        After creating the channel, you still have to join the CTF by registering in the official
        website of the CTF on behalf of the team. You can show the credentials by typing
        <b class="cmd">
          !addcreds &lt;key1&gt;=&lt;value1&gt; &lt;key2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt; ...</b> into the
        CTF channel. The credentials will be saved in the CTF embed message for others to use:
      <div class="flex flex-wrap">
        <img src="/img/help/addcreds.png">
        <img src="/img/help/ctf-info-embed-creds.png">
      </div>
      Of course, the inverse of this operation exists,
      called <b class="cmd">!rmvcreds &lt;key1&gt; &lt;key2&gt; ...</b>
      </p>

      <h3>CTF Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        To get notification 1 hour before the CTF starts, simply click the
         ðŸ‘Œ emoji reaction at the bottom of the CTF embed message.
      </p>

      <h3>Adding and Solving Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        On the CTF website itself, there should be a list of challenges that are open
        for us to solve. To track the progress of these challenges on our team's side,
        you will have to follow our workflow:
        <img src="/img/help/workflow.png">
      </p>
    <div class="bg-blue-600 p-4 border-l-4 border-blue-700 my-2">
      <span class="font-bold text-base">TIP</span>
      <p class="text-sm">Put all information regarding the challenge in Trello.
      Discord should used for asking help, reporting status, and complaining only!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-blue-600 p-4 border-l-4 border-blue-700">
      <span class="font-bold text-base">TIP</span>
      <p class="text-sm">All these commands are meant to be run in the CTF channel itself.
      Do not run these in other channels</p>
    </div>
      <p>
        <li class="font-mono">addchall</li>
    <b class="cmd">!addchall &lt;name&gt; &lt;cat1&gt;,&lt;cat2&gt;...</b> is used to add
    a challenge for tracking. <b class="h-mono">cat1,cat2,...</b> are the category the challenges
    belong to, usually categories like <b class="h-mono">pwn</b>, <b class="h-mono">web</b> and
    <b class="h-mono">crypto</b>. A card will be created in the Trello board under
    <b class="h-mono">To Do</b>.</p>
    <div>todo: picure here</div>
    <p>
    <li class="font-mono">rmvchall</li>
    <b class="cmd">!rmvchall &lt;name&gt;</b> removes the challenge from tracking.
    The associated Trello card is also removed.
    </p>
    <p>
    <li class="font-mono">workon</li>
    <b class="cmd">!workon &lt;name&gt;</b> is used to signal that you are working on the challenge.
    The associated Trello card will be moved to <b class="h-mono">Doing</b> with your Trello name as
    the assignee.
    <div>todo: picure here</div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <li class="font-mono">ditch</li>
    <b class="cmd">!ditch &lt;name&gt;</b> is used to signal that you are no longer working on the
    challenge. The associated Trello card will be moved back to <b class="h-mono">To Do</b> if you
    are the only one working on the challenge.
    Your Trello name will be removed from the card's list of assignees. If you are going to use
    this, please leave adequate information on your findings in the Trello card!
    </p>
    <p>
    <li class="font-mono">solve</li>
    <b class="cmd">!solve &lt;name&gt;</b> marks the challenge as solved, and the Trello card will
    be moved to the <b class="h-mono">Done</b> list. Congratulations!
    </p>
    <p>
    <li class="font-mono">unsolve</li>
    <b class="cmd">!unsolve &lt;name&gt;</b> brings the challenge back to unsolved status, and moves
    the card to the <b class="h-mono">To Do</b> list. Don't be fake news!
